# SQLite3-Database-with-TKinter
Just a Fun project. Decided to Create a Database Manager with GUI using Sqlite3 and Tkinter 

The Project uses SQLite3 (not to be confused with SQL) and Tkinter Libraries which are Python3 standard Libraries
i.e. you don't have to Install them, they come inbuilt with Python.

I just made it because I was Getting Bored....
